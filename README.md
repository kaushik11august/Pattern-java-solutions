<b>MK Car Servicing Project</b><br><br>
Welcome to the Car Servicing Project, a Java-based application designed to streamline car maintenance and servicing. This project provides a user-friendly interface to assist car owners in managing the servicing of their vehicles. With support for three types of cars - Sedan, SUV, and HatchBack - users can easily select their vehicle type, specify the required services, and receive a detailed bill. The system also handles scenarios where specific services or parts may not be available, providing clear messages to the user.

Key Features
Car Type Selection: Choose from Sedan, SUV, or HatchBack.
Service Customization: Specify the required services for your car.
Detailed Billing: Get a breakdown of the total bill, including individual service costs.
Service Availability: Receive messages for unavailable services or parts.
This project showcases Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles, demonstrating the power of Java in creating efficient and user-friendly applications. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project's development. We welcome your feedback and collaboration in enhancing this car servicing tool!
